    <table>
      <tr>
        1)  What is the temperature glazing is done at WH?
        2)  Check out glazes at local pottery stores. (?)
        3)  Find out if I can do 3 glazes at top and only one at bottom.
        4)  Does WH have clear glaze?

      Waxing: If you make a mistake, you can sand it off. (not great)
      If you want glaze (black?) in crevices, apply with sponge and then wipe off. Will leave in crevices.
      Works best if its a crevice in a raised part that you are applying wax to. Test what it looks like both ways.
      Load the glaze up on the top third, one glaze on bottom two at top that will drip down.

      Masking tape for straight glaze line at the bottom.
      Fill mug with glaze and then pour out.
      Dip to tape, then shake.  Continue to change orientation when shaking to make sure that one are doesn't glob up.
      Take tape off, clean up any drips on bottom.
      Use a pencil to set up your wax lines. (wheel good)
      Graphite pencils, they burn off in glaze firing.
      Use good brush so that stray hairs don't mess up pattern.
      Using wheel great for stripes. Not enough wax better than too much to avoid drips.
      Come back and make sure didn't miss any areas, easier than cleaning up later.
      Let wax dry for an hour or two after waxing so that the glaze will roll off better.
      Don't touch wax with hands as oils in hands makes wax less resistant later.
      Dip half at a time. Let bowl dry in between.
      Make a pattern with vinyl or tape.
      Make a line with wheel to align the pattern.  Add pattern, fill in center, add masking tape at bottom in line with underglaze line, and then coat with wax.

      Bisqueware: Fired in electric kiln once. Sounds like a bell.
      Greenware: Has not been fired. Sounds clunky.
      Glaze has a lot of silica, makes glaze relax in kiln (run down)
      Inside of foot ring needs to be glazed too if you add glaze to bottom.
      Look at sample tiles to differentiate the results by number of dips.
      If you don't stir glaze well, some of the important chemicals might be stuck at the bottom.
      Smoothe tong markes with finger and more glaze. You can lightly sand lumps with finger.
      Clean glaze off foot with slightly damp sponge.
      If you have missed any parts, you can go back and smooth more on.
      Once glaze is dry & pottery, be carefult not to knock. Wash hands between touching diff pieces of pottery, because finished colors might be different.

      Glazes are suspensions, not solutions.  Mix every time.
      Do inside first, Fill inside almost to top, pour out.
      Any spashing, wipe up. If there is a mess and get clay wet when cleaning, dry first before glazing outside. Damp clay doesn't absorb clay as much.
      Outside, hold by tongs, have mouth down absolutely flat.  There will be an air pocket preventing glaze from getting inside.
      rim-dip: Glaze already inside & outside, Again, flat dip, will add to rim & top outside.
      Brush accents onto it, not too thick or too thin.

      Stir every time you dip, even if you were just waiting for first dip to dry.
      Use glaze to enhance texture.  Make sure that you match glaze to texture (based on samples)
      Some glazes (archie series) need to be placed on top of another glaze or it will chip.
      Air bubbles: Buff with clean, dry hand. This will fill bubble with dust from glaze.
      Brushing: 2 coats on heavy-texture, 3 without heavy-texture.

    <h2> Bubble Glaze https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ly8kDDX2Ww</h2>
    <p6>
      Really complicated based on the number of supplies.
      Wipe down pottery with clean, damp sponge. (wait to dry)
      Mix underglaze. 3T distilled water, 1T Underglaze. 2-3 squirts liquid soap.
      Gently mix together.
      Use square container so that straw and glaze will stay in corner.  Longer straw.
      Place an old rag around rim of container.
      Blow bubbles in glaze, allow bubbles to fall into dish, rotate plate, let bubles settle & pop.
      Do same to outside of plate.
